## Wired

These programs will get the names date and times of the articles from the wired magazine site and put them in a spreadsheet.
This spreadsheet will then be read and uploaded into google sheets. There is a year for each sheet that the article appeared in.

The idea here is if you are a reader of wired magazine there was a particlar article you liked, you could bookmark it on your sheet
to reference back at a later date.

## Motivation
The motivation for this project started with understanding how to use python to update a excel workbook.
It lead to making this workbook accessable from anywhere on the net, hence the google sheets part.
